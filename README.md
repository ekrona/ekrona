What is ekrona?
----------------

ekrona is a modified version of Litecoin using scrypt as a proof-of-work algorithm:
 - 40 coins per block
 - 3.3 minutes block targets (200 seconds)
 - Subsidy halves in 500k blocks (ca. 3.3 years)
 - 40 million total coins
 - 324 blocks to retarget difficulty
 - starting at block 1000 re-target every block with exponential moving toward target spacing

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the ekrona client sofware, see cryptocointalk forum.
